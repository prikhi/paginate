# Paginate

`Paginate` is an Elm library for fetching & caching paginated responses
from an API.

**TODO:**

* Add Example, Link to Use in Real Apps
* Add a per-args cache? I.e., run toString on the fetch arguments to get a
    `Dict String (Dict PageNumber Chunk)`.


Eventually, an example project will be added to the repository, but for now you
can check out the following applications, which use this package for
pagination:
